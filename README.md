```
WHEN I type my note, I am presented with a "save" icon in the page header.
WHEN I save my note, my note is saved on the left-hand column of the page.
IF I click on a saved note, it will populate the right-hand column of the page for me to read.
WHEN I click the "+" button in the page header, my viewed note is cleared and I am presented with an empty text box to enter a new note.
WHEN I click the "Delete" button next to a saved note, that note is removed from the list of saved notes.
